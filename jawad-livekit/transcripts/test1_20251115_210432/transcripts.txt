[21:06:01] 👔 RECRUITER: OK, so what is the
[21:06:07] 👤 CANDIDATE: Okay, so what is the coefficient of the linear regression?
[21:06:14] 👤 CANDIDATE: I think you are you sure you are interviewing on Monday?
[21:06:32] 👤 CANDIDATE: Okay.
[21:06:39] 👤 CANDIDATE: Yes.

[21:07:35] 👤 CANDIDATE: is that you're going to use several several
[21:07:38] 👤 CANDIDATE: um batch of your data that are going to be that are going to be
[21:07:42] 👤 CANDIDATE: taken as random random
[21:07:42] 👤 CANDIDATE: we will train uh on like uh on like
[21:07:44] 👤 CANDIDATE: for example 80% of these random data of these random data
[21:07:47] 👤 CANDIDATE: and these are the other 20% so
[21:07:50] 👤 CANDIDATE: allows you to get a lot of information and to be sure that and to be sure that
[21:07:53] 👤 CANDIDATE: the model does not overfit. But
[21:07:59] 👤 CANDIDATE: on the data.

[21:08:09] 👤 CANDIDATE: Yeah, of course, retrogression is a, is a,
[21:08:15] 👤 CANDIDATE: is the L2 and the L2
[21:08:15] 👤 CANDIDATE: norm which is very interesting which is very interesting
[21:08:17] 👤 CANDIDATE: because you can solve it because you can solve it because you can solve it and and
[21:08:20] 👤 CANDIDATE: exactly by using a formula which is pretty much which is pretty
[21:08:26] 👤 CANDIDATE: much similar to one of the beta of the class one of the beta of the class
[21:08:26] 👤 CANDIDATE: It's not a formula that
[21:08:29] 👤 CANDIDATE: allows you to go to zero for the coefficients for that you need to
[21:08:32] 👤 CANDIDATE: use a laser which is using the using the
[21:08:35] 👤 CANDIDATE: L1 regression.
[21:08:41] 👤 CANDIDATE: I like this one
