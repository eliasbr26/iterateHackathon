[09:58:57] 👤 CANDIDATE: and learning and thank you for this interview
[09:59:18] 👤 CANDIDATE: Yeah, cross validation is a mean of, is a mean of
[09:59:24] 👤 CANDIDATE: avoiding avoiding avoiding.
[09:59:24] 👤 CANDIDATE: Overfitting, for example, for example,
[09:59:24] 👤 CANDIDATE: the most used cross-validation is cross-validation is
[09:59:27] 👤 CANDIDATE: scaffold cross-validation it's when you when you
[09:59:30] 👤 CANDIDATE: when you devise your trainset your trainset
[09:59:33] 👤 CANDIDATE: into k parts and you use a k minus we use a k minus
[09:59:36] 👤 CANDIDATE: one part to train your models and then your models and then
[09:59:39] 👤 CANDIDATE: one last part to put it
[09:59:42] 👤 CANDIDATE: together.
[09:59:45] 👤 CANDIDATE: Very useful to look at

[10:00:19] 👤 CANDIDATE: you add a lesser regulation term our variable will be a variable will be a
[10:00:42] 👤 CANDIDATE: Sorry, I don't know. I am not good at linear algebra. Linear algebra.
[10:00:58] 👤 CANDIDATE: Okay, sorry.
[10:01:15] 👤 CANDIDATE: I don't know, I think we could try to organize
[10:01:21] 👤 CANDIDATE: the metrics or something like this or something like
