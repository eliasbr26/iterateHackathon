[03:16:33] 👤 CANDIDATE: linear algebra? Uh, how do you, uh, how do you,
[03:16:34] 👤 CANDIDATE: regularize, uh, rise, uh,
[03:16:34] 👤 CANDIDATE: victories, I meet you victories, I meet you
[03:16:34] 👤 CANDIDATE: and how do you do and how do you do
[03:16:34] 👤 CANDIDATE: how do how do
[03:16:34] 👤 CANDIDATE: you do regularization in a in a in a in
[03:16:35] 👔 RECRUITER: okay so so
[03:16:42] 👔 RECRUITER: first if we want to if we want to
[03:16:42] 👔 RECRUITER: for example diagonal matrix diagonal matrix

[03:17:08] 👔 RECRUITER: To do that, we can compute
[03:17:14] 👔 RECRUITER: the the
[03:17:14] 👔 RECRUITER: characteristical polin polin
[03:17:15] 👤 CANDIDATE: It's okay, it's okay. Let's move to another subject. Let's move to another subject.
[03:17:22] 👔 RECRUITER: okay
[03:17:27] 👤 CANDIDATE: How do you do feature selection? Feature selection.
[03:17:27] 👤 CANDIDATE: In machine learning, how do you select? How do you select?
[03:17:33] 👔 RECRUITER: okay okay uh okay uh
[03:17:33] 👔 RECRUITER: um for example for example
[03:17:38] 👔 RECRUITER: I can uh I can come I can come
[03:17:38] 👔 RECRUITER: compute the correlation between the features between the features
[03:17:38] 👔 RECRUITER: and uh uh uh
[03:17:38] 👔 RECRUITER: and also with and also with uh
[03:17:41] 👔 RECRUITER: the question with the the the
[03:17:44] 👔 RECRUITER: the class for example the class for
[03:17:47] 👔 RECRUITER: example the class for example if we are in a the class for example if we are in a the class for example if we are in a
[03:17:53] 👔 RECRUITER: In a classification setting, for example, for example,
[03:17:56] 👔 RECRUITER: we can compute a matrix
[03:17:56] 👤 CANDIDATE: thank you
[03:18:02] 👔 RECRUITER: of correlation
